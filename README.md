# TaskAsin: Project Management Tool

**An Innovative Project Management Solution** üìù

Welcome to TaskAsin! This project management tool was created as part of my internship with CODSOFT. The goal was to build a comprehensive and responsive tool that helps teams and individuals manage their projects effectively. In this detailed description, you'll find information about the project's structure, technology stack, features, and deployment. Let's dive in!

## Overview

TaskAsin is a full-stack project management application that enables users to manage tasks, assign responsibilities, and track project progress. The frontend is built with React + Vite and TypeScript, offering a fast and modern user interface, while the backend uses Node.js and Express.js for a robust server-side foundation. Authentication and authorization are handled through JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ensuring security and role-based access. Input validation and sanitization are managed with Express Validator on the backend and Yup on the frontend. MongoDB serves as the primary database, providing scalability and flexibility.

## Key Features

- **Task Management**: Create, and assign tasks with detailed descriptions, and statuses. Assign tasks to individuals or teams for collaboration and tracking.
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Secure user authentication with JWT, allowing only authorized users to access protected routes and features. üîí
- **Input Validation and Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized using Express Validator and Yup, ensuring data integrity and security. ‚úÖ
- **Toast Notifications**: React Toastify is used to display success and error messages, providing real-time feedback to users. üéâ
- **Protected Routes**: Frontend routes are protected to prevent unauthorized access. Only logged-in users can view certain pages. üõ°Ô∏è
- **Responsive Design**: TaskAsin is designed to be responsive, offering a seamless user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones. üì±
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: CORS options and configuration are implemented to allow secure cross-origin communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Task Assignment**: Users can assign tasks to others, allowing for delegation and improved teamwork. ü§ù

## Technology Stack
